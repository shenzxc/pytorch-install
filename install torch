Head on to PyTorch's website to find the installation command for your environment. For me, as CUDA 10.2 is one of the older options, I've searched the 
commands through the previous versions. Although I was using a conda environment, using the conda installation commands did not work for me but pip install did. This could be a case-by-case situation.

What worked:
pip install torch==1.8.1+cu101 torchvision==0.9.1+cu101 torchaudio==0.8.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
